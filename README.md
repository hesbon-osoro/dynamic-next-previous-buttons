This project demonstrates how to create dynamic next and previous buttons.
The Next button shows the title of the next item to be shown on the UI.
The Previous buttons works the same.
These buttons works like a circular linked list.
That is, the Previous button of the first element takes to the last item in the array while the Next button of the last item takes to the first element in the array.
